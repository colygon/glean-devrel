## 🎯 Core Thesis

**"Enterprise AI apps need context. Glean provides it via APIs."**

Glean is positioned to become the foundational layer for enterprise AI applications—the "Stripe for enterprise knowledge" or "Twilio for AI context."

---

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Glean's API Platform Architecture

**Two Primary API Surfaces:**
- **Client API**: Chat, Search, Agents, Actions (user-facing operations)
- **Indexing API**: Documents, People, Permissions (data ingestion)

**Unique Differentiators:**
- Permission-aware results (no data leakage)
- Real-time organizational knowledge
- Open and interoperable (OpenAPI, multiple SDKs)
- AI-native architecture

### 2. MCP as Strategic Moat

**What is MCP?**
Model Context Protocol enables AI applications to securely access enterprise context.

**Why It Matters:**
- Works across Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and other AI clients
- Low barrier to entry for developers
- Network effects (more tools = more value)
- Glean can own the "enterprise AI context layer"

**Strategic Recommendation: Remote-First**
- Better than local MCP server
- Automatic updates, simplified auth, enterprise controls
- Phase 1: Local (current), Phase 2: Remote (roadmap), Phase 3: Marketplace

### 3. Four Core Integration Patterns

1. **Embedded AI Assistant** - Add Glean chat to internal apps
2. **Custom AI Agents** - Build specialized workflow agents
3. **Enterprise Search** - Integrate search into dashboards
4. **Content Indexing** - Sync custom data sources

Each pattern has code samples, architecture diagrams, and real-world examples.

## 🤔 Anticipated Questions & Answers

### Q: "What's your experience with enterprise APIs?"
**A**: X years building APIs and developer platforms. [Share specific examples]. Key learning: Developer experience is the product. If docs are confusing or samples don't work, adoption dies.

### Q: "How would you prioritize API features?"
**A**: Three inputs: (1) Customer feedback (support tickets, feature requests), (2) Usage data (which endpoints, error rates), (3) Strategic alignment (does it enable key use cases?). Balance quick wins with platform building.

### Q: "What's your approach to developer evangelism?"
**A**: Multi-channel: (1) Documentation that ranks on Google, (2) Code samples that actually work, (3) Conference talks that inspire, (4) Community that supports itself. Measure: adoption, engagement, satisfaction.

### Q: "How do you handle competing priorities?"
**A**: Focus on impact. Ask: What moves the needle on adoption? What unblocks customers? What builds moats? Say no to vanity metrics. Ship, measure, iterate.

### Q: "Tell me about a time you influenced product roadmap."
**A**: [Prepare specific STAR story]. Key: Gather data, tell stories, propose solutions, measure outcomes.
