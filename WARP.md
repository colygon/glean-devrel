# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a **static website and documentation repository** for Warp's Developer Relations strategy. It contains HTML landing pages, CSS styling, and comprehensive markdown documentation for 7 core DevRel programs.

## Working with This Repository

### Viewing the Site Locally

**Open HTML directly in browser:**
```bash
open index.html
open presentation.html
```

**Serve via HTTP server (recommended for testing links):**
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then open: http://localhost:8000
```

### Editing Content

Content is organized in these directories:

- **`docs/`** - Program documentation (7 markdown files covering all DevRel programs)
- **`programs/`** - Application templates (hacker house, grants, bounty submissions)
- **`tutorials/`** - User guides (getting-started.md, mcp-quickstart.md, advanced-workflows.md)
- **`workshops/`** - Workshop materials in subdirectories (mcp-basics/, warp-ai-workflows/, extension-development/)
- **`index.html`** - Main landing page
- **`presentation.html`** - Strategy presentation deck
- **`assets/css/`** - Styling (style.css for index.html, presentation.css for presentation.html)

### Previewing Changes

After editing, simply refresh your browser. No build process required.

## Architecture

### Site Structure

This is a **pure static site** with no build system, package.json, or dependencies. The architecture is straightforward:

1. **Entry Points:**
   - `index.html` - Main website with navigation to all programs, docs, and resources
   - `presentation.html` - Slide deck for presenting the DevRel strategy

2. **Content Organization:**
   - HTML files link directly to markdown documentation using relative paths
   - CSS files in `assets/css/` provide styling (2 files: one per HTML page)
   - Images stored in `assets/images/`

3. **Documentation Hierarchy:**
   - **Program Documentation** (`docs/`) - Detailed pages for each of the 7 programs
   - **Application Templates** (`programs/`) - Forms developers fill out to apply or submit
   - **Tutorials** (`tutorials/`) - Step-by-step guides for Warp users
   - **Workshops** (`workshops/`) - Course materials organized by topic

### How It Works

- `index.html` displays program cards that link to markdown files in `docs/`, `programs/`, and `tutorials/`
- Each program section includes overview, features, benefits, and application/participation links
- `presentation.html` is a self-contained slide deck styled with `assets/css/presentation.css`
- No JavaScript framework or templating system - pure HTML/CSS with markdown documentation

## Seven Core DevRel Programs

The repository documents these programs:

1. **Hacker House Residency** - 3-6 month SF residencies for developers building in the Warp ecosystem
2. **Co-working Space & Office Hours** - Weekly hybrid sessions with Warp team for guidance and collaboration
3. **Workshops Series** - Weekly technical workshops on MCP development, Warp features, and productivity (52/year)
4. **Monthly Hackathons** - Community hackathons with prizes, swag, and feature spotlights (12/year)
5. **Bounty System** - Monetary rewards for open-source contributions (MCP servers, integrations, tutorials)
6. **Grant Program** - $5K-$50K funding for innovative projects with quarterly reviews
7. **MCP Marketplace** - Curated marketplace of verified, secure MCP servers and Warp extensions

## Content Maintenance

When updating content:

1. **Program changes** - Edit corresponding file in `docs/`
2. **Application forms** - Update templates in `programs/`
3. **User guides** - Modify files in `tutorials/`
4. **Workshop materials** - Update subdirectories in `workshops/`
5. **Landing page** - Edit `index.html` and/or `presentation.html`
6. **Styling** - Modify `assets/css/style.css` or `assets/css/presentation.css`

All content should maintain consistency with the 7 core programs structure outlined in README.md.
