### Essential Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | macOS | Linux/Windows |
|--------|-------|---------------|

## Using AI Features

### AI Command Search

Press `Ctrl + `` to open AI command search:

**Example queries:**
- "list all files modified in the last 7 days"
- "find processes using port 3000"
- "compress this directory to tar.gz"

Warp will suggest the appropriate command. Press Enter to execute.

### AI Command Explanations

Hover over any command and click the AI icon to get:
- What the command does
- Explanation of each flag
- Potential risks or side effects

## Working with Blocks

### What are Blocks?

Each command you run creates a "block" containing:
- The command you ran
- The output
- Exit code and timing information

### Block Actions

Click the block menu (⋮) to:
- Copy output
- Share block as link
- Bookmark for later
- Export to file
- Collapse/expand

### Block Navigation

- `Cmd/Ctrl + ↑` - Previous block
- `Cmd/Ctrl + ↓` - Next block
- Click any block to focus it

## Workflows

Workflows let you save common command sequences.

### Creating a Workflow

1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + P`)
2. Type "Create Workflow"
3. Name your workflow
4. Add commands
5. Save

**Example: Deploy to Production**
```bash
git pull origin main
npm install
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

### Running a Workflow

1. Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + P`)
2. Search for your workflow name
3. Execute

Workflows can have parameters that you fill in at runtime!

## Customization

### Settings

Access settings: `Cmd/Ctrl + ,`

**Popular customizations:**
- Theme and colors

Perfect for pair programming and debugging together!

### Warp Drive (Cloud Features)

When signed in, Warp syncs:
- Settings and preferences
- Workflows
- Command history
- SSH connections
- Themes

Access your configuration from any machine!

## Tips & Tricks

### 1. Quick Directory Navigation

Use `Cmd + T` to open recent directories in a new tab.

### 2. Command History Search

Press `↑` to cycle through history, or `Ctrl + R` for fuzzy search.

### 3. Auto-suggestions

Warp suggests commands based on:
- Your history
- Current directory
- Common patterns

Press `→` or `Tab` to accept suggestions.

### 4. Copy-Paste Excellence

- `Cmd/Ctrl + C` - Copy selected text (or send SIGINT if nothing selected)
- `Cmd/Ctrl + V` - Paste
- No need for `Cmd + Shift + C/V` like in other terminals!

### 5. Split Panes

- `Cmd/Ctrl + D` - Split right
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + D` - Split down
- `Cmd/Ctrl + [` or `]` - Navigate between panes

## Common Tasks

### Git Workflow

```bash
# Check status
git status

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with AI-generated message
# (Use AI command search: "commit with message")

# Push
git push
```

### Docker Management

```bash
# List containers
docker ps

# View logs (block makes this cleaner!)
docker logs container_name

# Execute into container
docker exec -it container_name bash
```

### SSH Connections

Warp remembers SSH connections:

1. Connect once: `ssh user@host`
2. Next time, use Command Palette → "Connect to..." → Select host
3. Warp auto-completes credentials

## Troubleshooting

### Warp is slow

- Check Settings → Performance → Hardware Acceleration
- Reduce scrollback buffer size
- Disable unused integrations

### Commands not working

- Verify your shell configuration is loaded
- Check Settings → Shell → Path
- Try: `echo $SHELL` and `echo $PATH`

### AI features not working

- Ensure you're signed in
- Check internet connection
- Verify AI features enabled in Settings
