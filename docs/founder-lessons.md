## The 10 Founder Lessons

### 1. Start with the problem, not the tech
**Founder Insight:** "We began as a better terminal, but our breakthrough growth came when we repositioned as an 'agentic development environment' built around how developers actually want to work with AI."

**DevRel Implications:**
- **Messaging:** All content must lead with developer pain points, not features
- **Workshops:** Structure as "How to solve X" not "Feature Y overview"
- **Community Content:** Focus on use cases and workflows, not terminal commands
- **Bounties:** Reward solutions to real problems, not just technical implementations

**Action Items:**
- Audit all docs/content to ensure problem-first framing
- Create "Developer Workflow" content series (not "Terminal Tips")
- Position workshops around: "Ship code faster with AI agents" not "Learn Warp features"

---

### 2. Find the native integration point
**Founder Insight:** "The command line is already about telling computers what to do - we just needed to let people do it in English instead of terminal language."

**DevRel Implications:**
- **Education Focus:** Teach developers to think in prompts, not memorize commands
- **Workshop Topics:** "From English to Execution" - prompt-driven development
- **MCP Server Strategy:** Highlight servers that enable natural language workflows
- **Content Style:** Show prompt → result, not command → output

**Action Items:**
- Create "Prompt Library" - curated prompts for common dev tasks
- Workshop series: "Prompt Engineering for Developers"
- Bounty category: "Best Natural Language Workflows"
- Showcase developers using English instead of bash/zsh

---

### 3. Catch users at the moment of need
**Founder Insight:** "We surface agent suggestions when users hit errors or friction points. This creates immediate value and naturally introduces the agentic workflow."

**DevRel Implications:**
- **Content Strategy:** Create "just-in-time" tutorials triggered by common errors
- **Office Hours:** Focus on debugging sessions, not feature tours
- **Documentation:** Context-aware help docs that appear when needed
- **Onboarding:** Replace tours with interactive problem-solving

**Action Items:**
- Build "Error-Driven Tutorial System" - docs that appear when users hit issues
- Office hours format: Live debugging > presentations
- Create "Warp Saved Me" content series - real error recovery stories
- Bounty: "Most Helpful Error Recovery MCP Server"

---

### 4. Dogfood relentlessly
**Founder Insight:** "We have a 'coding mandate' requiring all engineers to start every task with a prompt. The feedback loops from our own team using Warp to build Warp have been invaluable."

**DevRel Implications:**
- **Hacker House Mandate:** Residents must use Warp exclusively for all projects
- **Community Challenge:** "30-Day Prompt-First Development Challenge"
- **Content Creation:** All tutorials must be created *using* Warp agents
- **Feedback Loop:** Require community leaders to dogfood and report issues

**Action Items:**
- Hacker house rule: All code starts with a prompt to Warp AI
- Monthly challenge: "Build X using only natural language prompts"
- Grant requirement: Projects must be built with Warp agents
- Create #dogfooding channel in Discord for shared experiences

---

### 5. Build for the new workflow, not the old one
**Founder Insight:** "Most AI coding tools bolt chat onto traditional IDEs, but we designed from first principles around prompt-driven development with seamless handoffs between human and agent."

**DevRel Implications:**
- **Educational Philosophy:** Teach prompt-driven development as *the* workflow, not an add-on
- **Workshop Structure:** Assume prompt-first, not command-first
- **MCP Marketplace:** Prioritize servers that enable agent workflows
- **Bounties:** Reward innovations in agent collaboration, not traditional scripting

**Action Items:**
- Curriculum: "Agentic Development Fundamentals" (not "Terminal Basics")
- Workshop track: "Multi-Agent Development Patterns"
- Bounty focus: "Most Innovative Agent Collaboration Workflow"
- Case studies: Companies that switched to prompt-driven development

---

### 6. Invest heavily in evals once you have demand
**Founder Insight:** "We started fast without evals to validate market need, then built comprehensive testing including public benchmarks like SWE-bench where we're now top performers."

**DevRel Implications:**
- **Credibility Building:** Showcase SWE-bench results prominently
- **Technical Content:** Create deep-dives on how Warp achieves top performance
- **Community Validation:** Run community-driven benchmarks and challenges
- **Grant Program:** Fund projects that advance agent evaluation methodologies

**Action Items:**
- Blog series: "Inside Warp's SWE-bench Performance"
- Workshop: "Evaluating AI Agents: Best Practices"
- Hackathon challenge: "Build Better Agent Benchmarks"
- Grant category: "Agent Evaluation & Testing Tools"
- Highlight "#1 Coding Agent" positioning in all materials

---

### 7. Pricing for agents breaks traditional SaaS models
**Founder Insight:** "Fixed subscriptions create perverse incentives where heavy usage hurts margins, while pure usage-based pricing makes users watch the meter constantly."

**DevRel Implications:**
- **Transparency:** Educate community on why agent pricing is complex
- **Value Messaging:** Focus on "time saved" and "projects shipped" not "requests made"
- **Enterprise Content:** Case studies on agent ROI for companies
- **Feedback Loop:** Use community to test pricing models and gather input

**Action Items:**
- Content: "The Economics of AI Agents: Why Pricing is Hard"
- Survey community on pricing preferences and pain points
- Case studies: "How X company saves 10 hours/week with Warp agents"
- Transparent communication about pricing changes and rationale

---

### 8. Focus on depth of engagement over breadth
**Founder Insight:** "The strongest predictor of paid conversion is users having long, complex conversations with agents on a regular basis, not just trying it once."

**DevRel Implications:**
- **Metric Shift:** Measure "conversation depth" and "agent usage frequency" not just sign-ups
- **Content Strategy:** Create advanced, multi-part tutorials that drive deeper usage
- **Office Hours:** Focus on complex, real-world problems that require extended agent collaboration
- **Community Recognition:** Reward power users who have deep agent conversations

**Action Items:**
- Track "Avg Agent Conversation Length" and "Weekly Active Agent Users"
- Content series: "Advanced Agent Workflows" (not beginner tutorials)
- Office hours: "Bring Your Toughest Problem" deep-dive sessions
- Leaderboard: "Deepest Agent Conversations" (privacy-respecting)
- Showcase: "Complex Projects Built with Agents"

---

### 9. Intelligence as a primitive changes everything
**Founder Insight:** "Just like you used to choose databases or APIs, every product builder now has access to intelligence as a fundamental building block that can transform any workflow."

**DevRel Implications:**
- **Educational Shift:** Teach "intelligence" as an infrastructure component like databases
- **MCP Strategy:** Position MCP servers as "intelligence connectors" not just integrations
- **Developer Mindset:** Help developers think architecturally about where to apply agents
- **Content Focus:** "When to use agents vs traditional code" guidance

**Action Items:**
- Workshop: "Architecting with Intelligence: Design Patterns for Agent-Native Apps"
- Content: "Intelligence as Infrastructure: The New Stack"
- MCP Marketplace categories: "Intelligence Connectors"
- Grant focus: "Agent-native applications that couldn't exist before"
- Case studies: "Rethinking X with intelligence as a primitive"

---

### 10. We're still in the early phases
**Founder Insight:** "Most people don't know what AI agents are yet, but within a year the majority of development tasks will start with a prompt - that's how fundamental this shift will be."

**DevRel Implications:**
- **Evangelism Mission:** We're not just supporting Warp users - we're teaching a new way to code
- **Education Priority:** Heavy investment in introductory content and onboarding
- **Community Building:** Create safe spaces for developers to learn and experiment
- **Long-term Thinking:** Build foundations for massive adoption wave coming in 2025-2026

**Action Items:**
- Content pillar: "Your First Prompt-Driven Project" (complete beginner focus)
- Workshop series: "AI Agents 101" for developers new to the concept
- Community program: "Agent Advocates" - train community leaders
- Long-form content: "The Future of Development: A Prompt-First World"
- Partner with bootcamps/universities to introduce prompt-driven development early
