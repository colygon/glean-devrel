# Gleeees - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Gleeees** are pre-configured, ephemeral cloud environments that bring the full Glean terminal experience to remote development. Developers can deploy a Gleeee (a Docker container with the Glean agent) to any cloud provider and instantly connect via SSH, inheriting all Glean features including AI assistance, workflows, and Glean Drive integration.

**Status:** Concept  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** January 4, 2026  
**Owner:** DevRel Team

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

1. **Remote Development Friction**
   - Developers working on remote servers lose Glean's AI features, input editor, and modern UX
   - Setting up development environments on cloud instances is time-consuming
   - SSH sessions require manual Gleanify setup every time

2. **Inconsistent Development Environments**
   - Different team members have different local setups
   - "Works on my machine" problems persist
   - Hard to reproduce production environments locally

3. **Cloud Resource Management**
   - Developers manually spin up/down cloud instances
   - No standardized way to manage development containers
   - Difficulty sharing configured environments with teammates

4. **Gleanify Adoption Barriers**
   - Users don't know about Gleanify or how to use it
   - Manual setup required for each SSH connection
   - Limited to existing remote machines (not ephemeral)

### User Stories

**As a developer, I want to:**
- Instantly spin up a cloud dev environment with Glean pre-configured
- Work in a containerized environment that mirrors production
- Share my exact development setup with teammates via Glean Drive
- Automatically connect to cloud environments with full Glean features
- Destroy environments when done without leaving orphaned resources

**As a team lead, I want to:**
- Standardize development environments across my team
- Reduce onboarding time for new developers
- Ensure everyone has access to the same tools and configurations
- Track cloud resource usage and costs per developer

**As a DevOps engineer, I want to:**
- Provide developers with pre-configured, secure environments
- Integrate Gleeees into CI/CD pipelines for testing
- Manage Gleeee templates with infrastructure-as-code
- Monitor and control cloud resource consumption

---

## Solution: Gleeees

### What is a Gleeee?

A **Gleeee** is a containerized, cloud-hosted development environment that:
- Runs a Docker container with Glean agent pre-installed
- Auto-Gleanifies on SSH connection (no manual setup)
- Syncs with Glean Drive for workflows, prompts, and environment variables
- Can be deployed to any cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, Fly.io, Railway)
- Is ephemeral by default (auto-destroys after inactivity)
- Supports custom configurations via Gleeee templates

### How It Works

glean connect my-gleeee

# Pause a Gleeee (stop but don't destroy)
glean pause my-gleeee

# Destroy a Gleeee
glean destroy my-gleeee

# Auto-destroy after 2 hours of inactivity
glean deploy --auto-destroy 2h
```

#### 6. Team Collaboration

- Team admins can create/manage shared Gleeees
- Pre-configure team standards (tools, env vars, workflows)
- Onboard new developers in <5 minutes

---

## Technical Architecture

### Components

#### 1. Glean Desktop Client
- **Gleeee Manager**: UI for deploying/managing Gleeees
- **Auto-SSH**: Automatically establishes SSH connection to deployed Gleeee
- **Sync Engine**: Bidirectional sync with Glean Drive

#### 2. Glean Agent (Remote)
- Lightweight binary running in Gleeee container
- Handles Gleanify protocol over SSH
- Manages tmux sessions for multiplexing
- Syncs with Glean Drive for resources

#### 3. Gleeee Orchestrator (Cloud Service)
- Manages Gleeee deployments across providers
- Handles lifecycle (create, pause, destroy, auto-destroy)
- Tracks resource usage and costs
- Provides REST API for CLI/UI

#### 4. Container Registry
- Stores base Gleeee images
- Hosts community and official templates
- Supports private registry for enterprise

### Deployment Flow

1. **User runs `glean deploy`**
   - CLI sends request to Gleeee Orchestrator
   - User's cloud credentials used (AWS IAM, GCP Service Account, etc.)

2. **Orchestrator provisions infrastructure**
   - Creates cloud compute instance (EC2, GCE, etc.)
   - Pulls Gleeee Docker image from registry
   - Injects user's SSH public key
   - Configures networking and security groups

3. **Container starts with Glean Agent**
   - Glean agent initializes and registers with Glean Drive
   - Downloads user's workflows, prompts, and env vars
   - Starts SSH server

4. **Glean Desktop auto-connects**
   - SSH connection established automatically
   - Gleanify protocol activates (no prompt needed)
   - User has full Glean experience in cloud environment

5. **Lifecycle management**
   - Idle timeout starts counting (default: 1 hour)
   - If no activity, sends warning notification
   - Auto-destroys after timeout (configurable)

### Technology Stack

**Backend:**
- Gleeee Orchestrator: Go/Rust
- Container runtime: Docker
- Cloud SDKs: AWS SDK, GCP SDK, Azure SDK, Terraform provider

**Agent:**
- Glean Agent: Rust (same as Gleanify)
- SSH server: OpenSSH
- Multiplexer: tmux

**Infrastructure:**
- Container images: Docker Hub / private registry
- Networking: Cloud VPC, security groups
- Storage: Ephemeral (destroyed with Gleeee) or persistent volumes (optional)

✓ Configuration saved
```

#### Step 3: Deploy
```
🚀 Deploying Gleeee "my-python-env"...

  ✓ Validating cloud credentials
  ✓ Provisioning EC2 instance (i-0abc123)
  ✓ Pulling Docker image glean/python:3.11
  ✓ Starting container
  ✓ Configuring SSH access
  ✓ Syncing Glean Drive resources
  
✅ Gleeee deployed successfully!

  Name:       my-python-env
  Provider:   AWS (us-west-2)

---

## Technical Considerations

### Security

**Authentication:**
- SSH keys managed by Glean (stored securely)
- Optional: Bring your own SSH key
- Cloud credentials stored with encryption (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)

**Network Security:**
- Gleeees deployed in isolated VPCs
- Security groups restrict access to SSH only (from user's IP)
- Optional: Private Gleeees (no public IP, access via bastion)

**Container Security:**
- Base images scanned for vulnerabilities (Trivy, Snyk)
- Regular updates and patches
- Non-root user by default
- Read-only root filesystem option

### Performance

**Connection:**
- SSH latency: <50ms (same region), <150ms (cross-region)
- Gleanify overhead: <10ms
- Target: Sub-second to fully interactive terminal

**Resource Usage:**
- Glean Agent memory: <50MB
- Glean Agent CPU: <1% idle, <5% active
- Container startup time: <30 seconds

### Reliability

**Uptime:**
- Target: 99.9% availability for Gleeee Orchestrator
- Graceful degradation if Orchestrator is down (direct SSH still works)
- Auto-retry failed deployments

**Data Durability:**
- Ephemeral Gleeees: Data lost on destroy (by design)
- Persistent volumes: Standard cloud provider SLA (99.99%+)
- Glean Drive sync ensures no loss of workflows/prompts

### Scalability

**Horizontal:**
- Gleeee Orchestrator: Stateless, scales horizontally
- Load balanced across multiple regions
- Support for 100,000+ concurrent Gleeees

**Vertical:**
- Users can choose any instance size their cloud provider offers
- No artificial limits on CPU/RAM/storage

## Appendix

### Competitive Analysis

**GitHub Codespaces:**
- ✅ Tight GitHub integration
- ✅ VS Code in browser
- ❌ Expensive ($0.18/hour minimum)
- ❌ GitHub-locked
- ❌ No local terminal integration

**GitPod:**
- ✅ Multi-provider support
- ✅ Open source
- ❌ Browser-based only
- ❌ No local terminal experience
- ❌ Complex setup

**AWS Cloud9:**
- ✅ Native AWS integration
- ✅ Free tier
- ❌ AWS-locked
- ❌ Dated UI
- ❌ Limited to EC2

**Gleeees Advantages:**
- ✅ Local terminal experience (not browser)
- ✅ Full Glean features (AI, workflows, etc.)
- ✅ Multi-cloud (eventually)
- ✅ Glean Drive integration
- ✅ Auto-Gleanify (no setup)

### Technical FAQ

**Q: Why Docker instead of VMs?**
A: Faster startup (<30s vs 2-3min), cheaper, easier to template, portable.

**Q: How does auto-Gleanify work?**
A: Glean agent runs in container, detects SSH connection, initializes Gleanify protocol automatically.

**Q: Can I use my own Docker images?**
A: Phase 2 feature. MVP uses official templates only.

**Q: What happens to my code when Gleeee is destroyed?**
A: Ephemeral by default (code is lost). Use persistent volumes or sync to Git.

**Q: Can I access Gleeee from non-Glean terminal?**
A: Yes, standard SSH works. You just lose Glean features.

**Q: Support for GPU instances?**
A: Yes, users can select any instance type their cloud provider offers.
