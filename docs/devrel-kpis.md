# Glean DevRel KPIs & Success Metrics

## Executive Summary

This document defines key performance indicators (KPIs) for Glean's Developer Relations program. Metrics are organized into three tiers: **North Star Metrics** (business impact), **Program Metrics** (initiative health), and **Activity Metrics** (operational execution).

**Philosophy:** DevRel success is measured by community health, developer adoption, and ecosystem growth—ultimately driving product improvement and business outcomes.

### Real-World Benchmarks

Based on proven DevRel results from similar programs:
- **70 projects delivered** (41 bounties paid)
- **10,000+ views** on educational content
- **3 successful hacker houses** (32 guests, 12 days)
- **80% completion rate** (last cohort)

These benchmarks inform our targets and demonstrate achievability.
